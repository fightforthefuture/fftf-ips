##FFTF IP Service

Small web app that takes a request and returns your IP.

We made this based on instructions in [this Stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/391979/get-client-ip-using-just-javascript). We like to record IP mostly to protect ourselves from spam bots that sometimes hammer our sign up forms. We use a service like this because most of our sites don't have any backend component so we need to grab the IP with javascript.
